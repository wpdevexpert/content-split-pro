## ü§î The Story Behind This Project

This tool was born out of a practical need for my YouTube story channel. I rely on **SPEECHMA**, a fantastic and free unlimited Text-to-Speech (TTS) platform, to generate the voice-overs for my scripts.

However, SPEECHMA has a limitation: it can only process a maximum of **2000 characters** at a time.

Simply cutting a long script at exactly 2000 characters would often result in awkwardly broken sentences, creating unnatural pauses and a poor listening experience for my audience. I needed a way to break down my scripts logically.

**Content Split Pro is the solution.** I built it to intelligently scan a long script and split it into blocks that are under a specified character limit, but it always makes the cut at the **nearest complete sentence**. This ensures that every block of text sent to SPEECHMA is a coherent paragraph, resulting in a smooth, natural-sounding voice-over every time.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Intelligent, Sentence-Aware Splitting:** The core feature! It breaks down text based on a character limit without splitting words, prioritizing natural sentence endings.
* **Use-Case Presets:** Quickly set the character limit for platforms like Twitter/X or use it for segmenting video scripts and presentations.
* **Real-Time Content Analysis:** Get instant feedback on your source text as you type, including:
    * Word & Character Counts
    * Sentence & Paragraph Counts
    * Flesch-Kincaid Reading Grade Level
    * Estimated Reading & Speaking Time
* **Interactive Block Management:** Mark generated blocks as "Done" to hide them from the main view and track your progress. Restore them with a single click.
* **Automatic Numbering:** All generated blocks are automatically numbered `(x/n)` to easily track their order.
* **Copy to Clipboard:** Each block has a "Copy" button that includes the content and its `(x/n)` numbering.
* **Zero Dependencies:** The entire application is a **single HTML file**. No installation, no build steps, and no internet connection required after the initial load.
* **Responsive Design:** Clean, modern, and fully usable on both desktop and mobile devices.
